Star Etl
========

*THIS PROJECT IS BY NO MEANS DONE OR SAFE TO USE!!!*

An attempt to (more) easily create star schemas for data warehousing. It's still packed full of assumptions.


Installation
------------

    $ gem install star_etl


Note on Patches/Pull Requests
-----------------------------
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
